# in this file i would reveal the steps followed to build this calculator and saving the most imporatant notes about newly discovered concepts and tricks
! i may take some notes that are related to fundamental and syntaxic details rather than the project itself, because for me this type of projects are mainly oriented for learning every new methods and items i come across  


## functions : 
we will use thre functions :
1) button function : handles what happens when the user clicks on the button
2) equal function : handle the calculation of the result
3) clear function : clear our calculator

## notes : 
when we write window.title("write here the title"), i wonder what is window.title() ? it's called a method, it's like a function but there are some major differences, you will more understand when you learn classes 
- method is defined inside a class and operates on a specific instance
- A method is a function that belongs to an object. It’s like a built-in tool attached to something, ready to act on or with it.
this is what copilot said about the differences :

when we write window=tk(), what is tk() in reality and how it works :
actually tk() is just like set(), list(), dict() .... they are all a class constructor, they are built in functions in python that create a new tk, set, list etc objects, so when i write set() i'm calling a class constuctor to make a set object so tk() make a tk object
