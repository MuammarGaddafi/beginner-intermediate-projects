# in this file i would reveal the steps followed to build this calculator and saving the most imporatant notes about newly discovered concepts and tricks


## functions : 
we will use thre functions :
1) button function : handles what happens when the user clicks on the button
2) equal function : handle the calculation of the result
3) clear function : clear our calculator

## notes : 
when we write window.title("write here the title"), i wonder what is window.title() ? it's called a method, it's like a function but there are some major differences, you will more understand when you learn classes 
- method is defined inside a class and operates on a specific instance
- A method is a function that belongs to an object. It’s like a built-in tool attached to something, ready to act on or with it.
this is what copilot said about the differences :
