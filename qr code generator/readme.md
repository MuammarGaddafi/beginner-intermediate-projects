# lets get some knowledge : how does the QR code work ? 

qr code, the achronym of quick response code, it is a code that scanners and devices can read but people cannot, it is like a whole language that has its own charachters and elements
!!! qr code is oriented for strings encoding not images and other media encoding

* 1st : the data modules : they are the black and white blocks in the qr code, and they handle storing all the information we wanna to convert into code

* eyes or finder patterns : they are the squares in the corners of the code, they allow  faster detection, even if the code is scanned at an angle or on inappropriate position, and they are surrounded by seperators to allow the scanner diffenciate between them and the data


* alignment marker : it helps the scanner to tell the orientation of the qr code

* can we have qr code with different colors : as long as it respects the qr code principals, which are based on contrast, you can color it
scanners read qr code depending on the color contrast --> which depends on the grayscale, while the constrast is preserved, the qr code still works
